Hi, I'm a 4th Year General Engineering Student at the University of Sheffied, specialising in Mechanical Engineering. In my spare time, I love tinkering with embedded electronics, exploring IT infastructure by running my own HomeLab as well as cycling and climbing when the sheffield weather permits it.
