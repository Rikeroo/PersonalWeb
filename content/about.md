Hi, I'm currently an Automotive Embedded Software Engineer working at Lotus Cars. My educational background is in Mechanical Engineering; studying General Engineering at the University of Sheffield and specialising in Mechanical, taking teh vast majority of modules from that department. I also chose Modules in Mathematical Computational Methods, covering the theory behind finite element models, Advanced Solids, explaining analytical techniques for determining stresses for complex geometries, Renewable Energy and Aerodynamic design as well as FEA and CFD modules.

For my final year dissertation, I chose to purse my interest in Machine Learning and Systems and Controls Engineering by creating a Reinforcement Learning controller for a complex multi-variable manufacturing process, using a novel method involving training in a bespoke LSTM Neural Network plant simulation.

In my spare time, I love tinkering with embedded electronics, exploring IT infrastructure by running my own HomeLab as well as cycling and climbing when the weather permits it.
