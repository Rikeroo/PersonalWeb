Hi, I'm a 4th Year General Engineering Student at the University of Sheffied, specialising in Mechanical Engineering. After specialising in 3rd Year, I chose Modules in Mathematical Computational Methods, covering the theory behind finite element models, Advanced Solids, explaining analytical techniques for determining stresses for complex geometries, Renewable Energy and Aerodynamic design as well as FEA and CFD modules. In my final year, I'm taking Additive Manufacturing, Advanced Fluid Dynamics, Advanced Energy and Power, and Design and Manufacture of Composites. For my dissertation, I am producing a Reinforcement Learning model for control and optimisation of a Thin Film Additive Manufacturing process. 

In my spare time, I love tinkering with embedded electronics, exploring IT infrastructure by running my own HomeLab as well as cycling and climbing when the sheffield weather permits it.
