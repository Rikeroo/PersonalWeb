      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m a 4th Year General Engineering Student at the University of Sheffied, specialising in Mechanical Engineering. After specialising in 3rd Year, I chose Modules in Mathematical Computational Methods, covering the theory behind finite element models, Advanced Solids, explaining analytical techniques for determining stresses for complex geometries, Renewable Energy and Aerodynamic design as well as FEA and CFD modules. In my final year, I&amp;rsquo;m taking Additive Manufacturing, Advanced Fluid Dynamics, Advanced Energy and Power, and Design and Manufacture of Composites.</description>

      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to learn web development for a while now. It allows for un-paralleled cross-platform distribution, while allowing me to tinker some more with my HomeLab and host my own applications with Docker. When thinking of a project I could embark on to help keep me motivated and with me a clear goal, I was reminded of my love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with workout tracking apps. I love the idea of having lots of data and seeing pretty graphs go up, but every app I&amp;rsquo;ve tried in one way or another doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit my routine and/or lacks features I want, while having lots of features I don&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>Introduction PCB design has been something I’ve wanted to learn for a while now, and instead of reading extensively into the topic, I thought the best way to learn was to dive into a simple project and get my hands dirty. I thought up a fairly simple concept for a ‘habit reminder&amp;rsquo; with a configurable screen to display tasks and completion status as well as satisfying tactile buttons for when the task is completed.</description>
