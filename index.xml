      <description>Hi, I&amp;rsquo;m currently an Automotive Embedded Software Engineer working at Lotus Cars. My educational background is in Mechanical Engineering; studying General Engineering at the University of Sheffield and specialising in Mechanical, taking teh vast majority of modules from that department. I also chose Modules in Mathematical Computational Methods, covering the theory behind finite element models, Advanced Solids, explaining analytical techniques for determining stresses for complex geometries, Renewable Energy and Aerodynamic design as well as FEA and CFD modules.</description>

      <description>Introduction PCB design has been something I’ve wanted to learn for a while now, and instead of reading extensively into the topic, I thought the best way to learn was to dive into a simple project and get my hands dirty. I thought up a fairly simple concept for a ‘habit reminder&amp;rsquo; with a configurable screen to display tasks and completion status as well as satisfying tactile buttons for when the task is completed.</description>
