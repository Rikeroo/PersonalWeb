      <description>Introduction I&amp;rsquo;ve wanted to learn web development for a while now. It allows for un-paralleled cross-platform distribution, while allowing me to tinker some more with my HomeLab and host my own applications with Docker. When thinking of a project I could embark on to help keep me motivated and with me a clear goal, I was reminded of my love-hate (mostly hate) relationship with workout tracking apps.
